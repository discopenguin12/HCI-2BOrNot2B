# Projcet Name: Swole Patrol

This is a fitness application in which people from all skill level (beginner to experts)
This application will allow the user to set up their workout routine for each day.
They will have a wide variety of choices to choose from, and it can be randomly chosen for them.
There will be a forum in which they can communicate with other people who can share ideas and help
other people out. We also plan on having a competition feature to motivate users to workout out more.
